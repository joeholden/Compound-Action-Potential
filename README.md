# Compound-Action-Potential
This program takes in .abf electrophysiology recording files of compound action potentials. 
It identifies the peak and trough of the waveform and colors in the area of each. 
It calculates the area of each of these regions as well as the latency to spike initiation from pulse.
These parameters and the colored figure are output to directories as .xlsx and .png files.
There is a GUI bundled as an .exe so others without coding knowledge can run it.
